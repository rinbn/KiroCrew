# Runtime Ownership — Design Document

## Overview

One agent runtime is one operating-system process, and one process can serve
several sessions. Everything in this spec follows from that sentence. A pid names
a process, never a session, so any code that reads a pid to mean "this session's
runtime" is making a statement about the wrong subject as soon as a sub-agent's
session sits beside its principal's on one process: a teardown ends a neighbour's
live process, a retry budget is charged to a session that did nothing wrong, a
stall verdict is derived from a co-tenant's activity.

The model is three rules:

1. **A pool owns the process.** `runtime_ownership.RuntimeOwnership` places a
   session on a runtime and hands back a lease. A session never names a pid.
2. **Anyone who may end a runtime holds a lease; anyone who is merely using one
   holds a tenancy.** `runtime_ownership.RuntimeTenancy` is the second table,
   because the two claims are held by different parties and answer different
   questions.
3. **Exactly one function decides whether a runtime may die.**
   `runtime_ownership.authorize_runtime_kill` asks both tables and records who
   fired. Every other path asks it first.

What this spec owns: the two ownership tables, the kill gate, death
classification, the kernel-versus-registry reconciler, the pid-shaped guards, and
the asymmetries between platforms. What it does not own: the session registry and
the sweep that drives the cleanup tick ([session.md](session.md)), the eight-step
peer check on a shared pid ([dashboard-token-auth.md](dashboard-token-auth.md) §
*Unix-socket transport: kernel-attested `X-Session-Key`*), and the threat model
([security.md](security.md)).

`runtime_ownership` imports nothing from `kiro_crew`. It is a leaf on purpose:
`session_pid` is the pid-bookkeeping leaf and calls the gate, so an import in the
other direction would close `session_pid → acp → acp.runtime → session_pid`.

### What the model is made of

| Mechanism | Where it lives |
|---|---|
| The lease table, and a lease taken where a chat session joins the registry | `runtime_ownership.RuntimeOwnership`, `acquire_session_lease` |
| The tenancy table, so a party that cannot hold a lease is still defended | `runtime_ownership.RuntimeTenancy`, `claim_runtime_tenancy` |
| The one gate, and the release-before-signal rule every kill path obeys | `runtime_ownership.authorize_runtime_kill`, `process_identity.release_teardown_lease` |
| One death classified once, read by every tenant of the process | `runtime_death.announce`, `caused_by_this_session` |
| The kernel compared against the registry, in both directions | `runtime_reconcile.RuntimeReconciler`, `session_scope_reap.instance_slice_pids` |
| One client-side identity ladder, and a pid mapping that records its tenants | `mcp_caller.resolve_own_identity`, `session_pid_sig.read_session_pid_mapping` |
| Liveness attributed per probe rather than claimed per module | `acp.liveness.LivenessOracle` |
| A cgroup scope named after the runtime that holds it | `sandbox.scope_unit_name`, `name_scope_unit` |
| Two counts of the pattern being removed, each allowed to fall only | `test/test_kill_chokepoint_ratchet.py`, `test/test_pid_reader_ratchet.py` |

## The model

### Leases

`RuntimeOwnership.acquire(key, session_key, spawn, cap=...)` returns an
`Acquisition`. Placement prefers the runtime this session key last landed on while
it is alive and has room, then any compatible runtime with room, then `spawn()`.
Room means fewer than `cap` leases. A runtime lives while at least one lease is
outstanding; the **last** release hands it back for teardown and every earlier
release only drops a reference.

`cap` is `runtime_ownership.CHAT_RUNTIME_CAP`, and it is **1** today. At that cap
no entry holding a lease has room, so every acquisition spawns and every release
is a last release — byte-for-byte the unpooled behaviour, with the claim recorded.
Raising it is a behaviour change that needs the eligibility rules deciding which
sessions may share a process, and those do not live here.

**A founding `spawn()` holds nothing.** The table's bookkeeping — entries, the
lease index, the last-runtime map, foundings in flight — is only read or written
in stretches with no `await`, which on one event loop is what keeps it consistent
and what keeps a cancellation from landing mid-change; there is no registry lock.
`spawn()` runs outside every such stretch, so a real launch (admission wait,
subprocess, ACP handshake) never makes an unrelated `acquire` or any `release`
wait, and founding starts on different keys overlap. A miss registers a per-key
founding; a same-key arrival waits on it only while the launching runtime will
still have room for it (founder plus waiters below `cap`), and otherwise founds
concurrently, because waiting would just serialize two launches. At `cap=1` nobody
ever waits. A waiter is shielded from the founder's fate: it wakes on success,
failure or cancellation alike and re-picks, founding itself if it must, so a
founder's error is never handed to another session. Every exit from the founder
clears the marker and wakes its waiters; a runtime is published in the same
synchronous stretch in which `spawn()` returns, so no cancellation point lies
between a spawned runtime and its entry.

On the **chat** registration path a lease means the same thing as registry
membership, which is why it is taken there rather than at provider start:
`session_allocation.SessionAllocationService._get_or_create_impl` calls
`acquire_session_lease` immediately after the session enters `self._sessions`.
Before that line no tenant exists, which is why every earlier cleanup path in that
file may kill unconditionally.

That equivalence holds for chat and nowhere else, and the difference matters to
anyone reading a lease count as a tenancy count. `acquire_session_lease` is reached
from the chat registration path alone: `open_task_session` registers a session
without one, the task-run path forces `_owns_runtime = False` on the provider it
hands the runtime to, and a companion runtime is spawned bare. So **no shared
runtime holds a lease**, `outstanding_leases` reads 0 for a perfectly healthy one,
and what defends it is a tenancy. A mechanism keyed on lease absence would end a
task run's runtime at the close of its first step.

### Tenancies

A lease is a claim by a party that MAY end the runtime. A tenancy is a claim by a
party that is using a process it may NOT end: a session-sharing sub-agent mid-turn
on its principal's runtime (`acp.session_provider.AcpSessionProvider._claim_shared_turn`
/ `_end_shared_turn`), and the OAuth mint child mid-exchange
(`connections.mint`). At `cap=1` a tenancy is the only way such a party is
represented at all, because an acquisition cannot join an occupied runtime.

A claim records two things: `holder`, a label written for the refusal log, and
`session_key`, the auth binding (`RuntimeTenancy.claim(target, holder=...,
session_key=...)`). Session claimers (a sharing sub-agent's turn, a task run) pass
their key; the OAuth mint child passes none and binds nothing. The claim is the
record that binds a sharing sub-agent's `X-Session-Key` to its process: a
sub-agent holds no lease, so without the claim nothing would place its session on
the pid (`tenant_keys_on_pid`, read through `session_keys_bound_to_pid`).

The two tables are separate for a reason a single refcount cannot express: a
tenancy has to outlive the lease. A principal's last release forgets the lease
entry, and that is the exact moment a co-tenant becomes undefended.

The scope of a sub-agent's tenancy is the **turn**, not the object's lifetime. A
turn is the interval in which ending the process destroys work that is never
retried; an idle sub-agent holding a claim for its whole life would pin a runtime
nobody is using.

A self-shield is not a tenancy. Every `AcpRuntime` shields its own pid as it spawns
and drops the shield only once its kill has succeeded, so
`session_pid._PROTECTED_PIDS` is held for the whole life of the very process its
owner is entitled to end. The gate therefore **never** reads it: doing so would
refuse every ordinary teardown and leak the process it declined to signal. A
tenancy is taken by a party that is not the owner, is named, and is released when
that party is done — which is what lets the gate refuse on its behalf without ever
refusing an owner.

## The one kill gate

`authorize_runtime_kill(target, *, reason, caller) -> bool` returns a verdict and
does not kill. Ownership ("does anyone still need this runtime?") and identity
("is this pid still the process I recorded?", `process_identity`) are different
questions, and a caller that owns a careful escalation — a SIGTERM grace before
SIGKILL, a process group proved by a vouching member, a Windows tree pinned by
handle — keeps that escalation and asks the gate once, at the top. Folding them
together would mean re-resolving a process group from a pid at signal time, which
is the identity defect.

False means REFUSED, on either of two grounds:

- **Leases outstanding.** The caller holds a pid it does not own. A caller that
  legitimately ends this runtime releases its lease first and is then authorized;
  one that signals without releasing is refusing its own teardown. The gate
  therefore depends on every release site releasing first: a gate without them
  would decline every force-kill path and leak the process it declines to signal.
- **Tenancies outstanding.** Somebody who does not own the process is mid-flight
  on it. This refusal is not the caller's mistake — the owner may have released
  correctly — and the remedy is to let the tenant finish.

Both outcomes log at WARNING. The allow path logs through
`note_runtime_kill`, so there is one attribution implementation and the refusal is
the only thing the gate adds:

```
runtime_ownership REFUSED kill pid=<pid> leases=<n> caller=<caller> reason=<reason>:
  the process is still leased, so this caller must release before it signals
runtime_ownership REFUSED kill pid=<pid> tenants=<n> holders=<a,b> caller=<caller> reason=<reason>:
  a party that does not own this process is still using it
```

Two call sites are pinned by test, and the rest hold by convention. That
difference is load-bearing for anyone adding a kill path, so it is stated rather
than blurred:

| Call site | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| `session_pid._sync_kill_provider` — the funnel the session layer's hard-kill sites reach | `test_kill_chokepoint_ratchet.py`'s `ATTRIBUTED_KILL_PATHS`: must call the gate, must pass `reason` and `caller`, must act on the verdict |
| `acp.runtime.AcpRuntime.kill` | same |
| `cron._sigkill_session` | convention |
| `session_cleanup._kill_authorized` | convention |
| `session_scope_reap._stop_and_signal_members` | convention |
| `subagent_manager.monitoring._reconcile_orphans_impl` | convention |
| `subagent_manager.terminal._sigkill_session_impl` | convention |
| `runtime_reconcile._default_authorize` | convention |
| `runtime_reconcile.RuntimeReconciler.reclaim_untracked` (through the same `_authorize` seam) | convention |

A convention site that drops its gate call is not caught: the primitive call it
still makes stays counted, so `BYPASS_BASELINE` does not move and the suite stays
green. Adding a site to `ATTRIBUTED_KILL_PATHS` is what promotes it.

Releasing before the signal is shared rather than re-implemented:
`process_identity.release_teardown_lease` releases the lease held by the teardown's
OWN subject — matched by the handle's pid and start identity, from the manager's
torn-down table and from the caller's captured pop — and touches no tenancy and no
other session's lease. It is best effort by design: a release that did not happen
costs an honest refusal, while an exception raised out of it would cost a wedged
process its only remaining kill.

The funnel also ends a registration that is not a lease. A provider reaching
`_sync_kill_provider` is being abandoned — its client's `shutdown` will never run —
so the funnel calls the client's own synchronous hand-back for its
`settings.local.json` seed (`AcpClient.release_settings_seed_claim`, resolved by
name so this leaf stays ignorant of the ACP layer). Without it the client's live
claim on that seed outlived the client for the life of the gateway and every later
session on the same work dir read the path as a live sibling's. The hand-back
follows the gate's verdict rather than running ahead of it, because a successor
that adopts the seed re-writes `permissions.defaultMode` on disk, and that must not
happen under a runtime that may still be running:

- **released** when the teardown is authorized and committed, immediately before
  the first signal (ahead of the grace, so a replacement spawn on the same work dir
  finds the slot free when it seeds); when there is no pid at all (a seed is
  written before the spawn publishes one, so the claim belongs to the client
  object and no runtime stands behind it); and when the recorded root is known to
  be gone or recycled (`_root_identity_refuted`: the pid names no process, or a
  live start identity was read and differs from the recorded one);
- **kept** while the gate refuses the kill because a lease or a tenancy still
  holds the runtime, and when the root's identity cannot be read (the pid exists
  but its start identity is unavailable, or none was recorded at spawn). A kept
  claim keeps the successor on the live-sibling rule — it declines its own seed
  rather than re-seeding the file — and is handed back by a later teardown of the
  same runtime or reclaimed as stale once this process exits.

Like the lease release it is best effort and never lets an exception out. Which
registrations it withdraws, and why the durable half, is the seed's own spec
([claude-code-provider.md](claude-code-provider.md) § *Session-scoped Claude
settings*).

### Kill owed, and the hand-back

A refusal on tenancy grounds would otherwise lose the teardown: the owner has
released, nobody will ask again, and the process outlives every record of it. So
the refusal records a **debt** on the claims it refused for
(`RuntimeTenancy.refuse_for_tenants`), and the last tenant out of a runtime that
owes one is handed the runtime back:

```
runtime_tenancy outcome=kill_owed_handback pid=<pid> holder=<holder>: ...
```

The count and the debt are one call, not a read followed by a write, because the
two can straddle the last tenant's departure and leave a debt owed by a process
that has no tenants — to be spent on whichever runtime holds that pid later. The
debt is keyed so it cannot migrate to a process that reuses the pid
(`test_runtime_ownership.py::test_refusal_debt_does_not_migrate_to_a_later_process_reusing_the_pid`).

A verdict is a statement about the past, so an authorized kill also takes a
barrier before it signals: `tenancy_epoch` is read right after the allow and
`commit_runtime_teardown` is called immediately before the first signal. A claim
that lands in between makes the commit fail and the kill is **abandoned**, because
the signal would land on a live turn that is never retried. A claim arriving after
the commit is refused with `RuntimeTeardownCommitted` rather than granted. The
barrier is dropped on every exit from the signal path, including a raise — a pid
left committed is one no tenant can claim for the life of the gateway.

## A death is a process event

`runtime_death.announce` is called ONCE, where the death is detected, and records
what the process was carrying at that instant. Every tenant then reads the same
record instead of re-deriving one, and the question a retry budget or a circuit
breaker asks is `runtime_death.caused_by_this_session(target)` — by handle, never
by pid, because a session that can name a pid can signal it.

One record is what keeps a single process death from costing N resets, N budget
charges and N unrelated accounts of why. A death on a shared runtime takes every
session on the process with it, several of them mid-prompt, and a tenant deciding alone has no way to tell that loss from its own failure.

The record carries two independent readings of co-tenancy, and both are needed.
`leases` is what the lease table holds; `acp_sessions` is how many ACP sessions the
process was actually multiplexing. A sub-agent runs on its parent's runtime and
holds no lease, so the registry alone would call that process single-tenant and
hand the parent the bill. The runtime alone would miss a tenant that has a lease
but has not opened its session yet. The lease reading is also not available on
every path, and the contract says so: on a REAPED death the return code is already
set, so the registry considers the runtime dead and the lease count is 0 whatever
it holds.

Tenants PULL the record rather than being pushed it. A tenant learns of the death
the way it already does — its poisoned session queue raises into whatever turn it
had — and reads the record while handling it. A tenant with no turn in flight has
nothing to recover and re-acquires on its next turn, which drops a dead runtime on
the way past. There is deliberately no observer registry: a notification channel
with no subscriber is a mechanism whose first real consumer would have to redesign
it.

A shared death still has to bound recovery, so it is counted per session
(`note_shared_death` / `clear_shared_deaths`) as the substitute ceiling for the
per-session streak it is exempt from. A substitute ceiling must share the key and
the clearing point of the counter it replaces, or it never trips. Its contract:

- **Charge sites.** The typed recovery handlers (dashboard chat, task executor,
  cron, the Slack sub-agent path) and, for channel dispatchers that catch a failed
  turn generically, `messaging.dispatch.charge_turn_failure`. Only a process death
  the session did not cause (`caused_by_this_session` false) is exempt; every
  other failure charges the session's own counter.
- **Budget.** The re-queue is bounded by `max(own streak, shared streak)` against
  the same ladder limit, so a shared death never refunds attempts the session
  already spent.
- **Hand-over at the limit.** At the threshold the caller performs the actuator
  the counter stood in for (the same reset the breaker performs) rather than
  charging the session; the streak is cleared after that hand-over returns, and on
  any landed turn. Nothing refunds a charge.
- **Keys.** A session's own key; a cron job's streak is keyed `cron:<job.id>`.
- **Table bounds.** At most `_SHARED_STREAK_MAX_KEYS` (512) keys, evicting the
  least recently touched; a key longer than 256 characters is stored as a
  `sha256:` digest, never truncated.
- **User-facing strings.** When the shared ceiling is reached the dashboard says
  "The agent process this chat shares kept restarting — please retry."
- **Sub-agent guard.** A sub-agent whose provider died resets its parent only
  when `caused_by_this_session` is true; on a shared runtime's death the parent
  and its co-tenants are left alone.

## Reconciliation: the kernel against the registry

Every other sweep in the gateway asks "is this pid one I still need?" and asks it
of a record. `runtime_reconcile.RuntimeReconciler` asks the kernel instead, and
compares both answers in **both** directions, because each direction is a
different leak:

| Direction | What it means | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `owned_dead` | A record names a pid that is gone, or one the kernel gave to an unrelated process. | Retract the record; tell the holder once. The stranger is never signalled. |
| `unowned_alive` | A process runs in this install's own agent slice and no record claims it, and it is not excluded as sandboxed tool work (below). | Count it. Kill only when every condition below holds. |
| `owned_alive` | The healthy population. | Reported as the denominator. |

`unowned_alive` and `owned_dead` are the SLI, published so an operator sees a leak
while it is small; the actions are what makes a non-zero reading temporary rather
than permanent. `test/e2e/process_inventory.py` uses the same three names for the
same reconciliation read from outside the process, so a published reading and an
external inventory describe one host state in one vocabulary.

One qualification on that shared vocabulary: `resource_status.slice_ownership`
publishes `unowned_alive` as every unclaimed slice pid, while the reconciler's own
reading subtracts the tool-marker exclusion. On a host doing long-lived tool work the
two therefore disagree by design, and the larger number is not a fault — it answers
"what is unclaimed", where the reconciler's answers "what this arm can act on".

A recycled pid belongs in `owned_dead` and not in the healthy population, which is
what makes the reading a usable safety number: a record whose pid now names a
stranger is the exact input that turns a sweep signalling by pid into a kill of
somebody else's process.

Mounted on the cleanup tick at
`session_cleanup.SessionCleanup._reconcile_runtimes_hook`, built once and
retained across ticks because the two-pass confirmation IS its state. Two whole-pass
refusals come first, because a half-read pass is the dangerous one: a kernel
reading that cannot be taken, and a registry that cannot be read, each refuse the
entire pass rather than acting on the half that answered. An incomplete active-pid
union does the same.

A refused pass reclaims nothing and publishes no counts, so it surfaces at WARNING
(`SessionCleanup._note_reconcile_refusal`): once per
`RECONCILE_REFUSAL_WARN_INTERVAL_SECS` (3600s) while the same reason persists, at
once when the reason changes, with the exact reason at debug every tick. The first
supported pass after a refusal logs the recovery and re-arms the warning
(`_clear_reconcile_refusal`).

The registry is every record this process can read for the data home, because the
slice is scoped to the data home too: the manager's live-pid union, the MCP backend
pidfile, both tracked pid files across every gateway pid, and the app backend's own
process table. An app backend runs in the slice and is none of the others.
`apps.backend.running_spawned_backend_pids` names the root pid of each backend this
process spawned, while its `Popen` handle says the child is running: a child that has
not been reaped keeps its pid, so the number provably names the backend, and one that
has exited leaves the registry instead of reading as a dead runtime. Where this
gateway's own wrap inserted a forking sandbox launcher -- the Linux namespace
launcher, whose `Popen` root is the launcher parent and whose forked child is the real
server -- that root's direct children are named too, because the handle alone would
leave the server (a sibling in the same slice) claimed by nothing. The table is
in-process memory, never `app_backends.pids.json`. That file lives in the
agent-writable data home and is only the stale-reap's record, so reading it for
membership would let a written row make any pid owned. The table claims a spawned
backend's root process, plus the launcher's forked server child where the wrap forks:
an adopted backend, the processes a backend forks BELOW that server child, and a
backend another process on this data home spawned are not in it.

### Leaked untracked runtimes: read every pass, reclaimed only on a user confirm

`session_pid`'s report-only arm finds a managed runtime reparented to init with our marker and in neither pid file. Every pass copies its current hits into the reading as `leaked_untracked`, `leaked_rss_bytes` (each root counted with its descendants) and `leaked`, Linux only. No scheduled arm acts on them.

`RuntimeReconciler.reclaim_untracked` is the one path that may, and its only caller is the owner-only `POST /api/system/leaked-runtimes/reclaim` with `{"confirm": true}`. A candidate must have been reported by a sweep and be detected again on a complete tracked snapshot. Each condition can only withhold: tracked, protected, leased or claimed; not a managed harness; no spawn marker; younger than the age floor; a `KIROCREW_SPAWN_HOME` that is absent or names another data home (the marker is shared by every install on this uid, and a sibling's runtime is tracked only in its own pid files); a live session leader or group leader other than itself (the session id comes from `platform_compat.read_proc_stat`, so a leader whose name is not UTF-8 still reads as live); no readable `KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE`; or any live process outside its own tree carrying the same instance. The last one is what keeps a live runtime's descendant safe: the stamps are inherited, so that runtime itself holds the instance. The start identity is re-read before `authorize_runtime_kill` and pinned into `_kill_pid_tree`, under the tenancy barrier, at most `min(session.reconcile_max_kills, DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS)` trees per call. At a budget of `0` every candidate is refused "kill budget spent" and audited `refused`.

### Why an unowned process is counted before it is killed

Absence from the record is evidence that something is unclaimed, not evidence that
it is abandoned. The unowned population on a healthy host is dominated by processes
with perfectly good owners that no *session* record describes: a Playwright
chromium tree owned by a browser panel, `mcp start-server` processes owned by a
stub connection, sandbox shim wrappers owned by a spawn in progress. Killing on
first sight would take a user's live browser out from under them and call it a leak
fixed. Such processes are present on a healthy host at rest and grow under load.

One class leaves the population before any of that, in `_unowned` rather than by a
condition: a pid carrying the `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_TOOL` marker whose argv0 is **not** a
managed harness. The sandbox chokepoint stamps that marker on every tree it spawns, so
a build, an `npx` install or a provisioning run is identified as tool work by
exec-time state a same-uid process cannot forge on another process, rather than by the
argv0 the name test reads. Both conditions are required, because the marker describes
a tree while the argv test is per process: the chokepoint takes harness argv on purpose
(`is_kiro_cli`), and a marked tool tree can spawn a harness, so an orphaned harness can
carry the marker without being tool work and must stay reachable. The exclusion is
therefore exactly the population the argv condition withheld already — the arm's reach
is unchanged, and what it removes is their per-pass count, gate allow and attribution.
It FAILS OPEN, unlike every condition below: an unreadable marker leaves the pid a
candidate, because a sparing that fails closed would widen what escapes the conditions
on doubt.

So a kill needs all of these, and any one missing leaves the process alone and
merely counted (`RuntimeReconciler._why_not_yet`, `_reconcile_unowned`):

1. the per-pass kill budget is not spent — `runtime_reconcile.DEFAULT_MAX_KILLS` is
   the shipped value and `session.reconcile_max_kills` bounds it, with a ceiling
   equal to that default so the setting can only lower the budget and never raise
   it; the budget is re-read on every cleanup tick. At `0` the arm evaluates the
   local conditions (two-pass confirmation, argv, spawn marker, age, unclaimed,
   unchanged identity), counts each full candidate in `would_kill`, and signals
   nothing. The ownership gate and the teardown barrier are deliberately not
   consulted there, so no kill authorization is logged. A reconciler that is wrong about a whole population is wrong slowly
   enough to be noticed;
2. it was unowned on the PREVIOUS pass too, keyed on pid **and** process identity
   so a recycled pid cannot inherit the confirmation;
3. its argv names a harness this gateway manages
   (`runtime_reconcile.process_is_a_managed_agent`, the kill seam's own recycle
   guard asked here at the decision point). Most of the unowned population carries
   the inherited spawn marker and is not a harness — a Playwright chromium tree, an
   `mcp start-server` broker, a sandbox shim, another install's interpreter — and
   the seam declines every one. A sandbox shim is declined for what it WRAPS, not
   for being a shim: on Linux the namespace launcher is the pid a real agent runtime
   is tracked under, so the gate steps over the launcher and asks its positional
   rules of the wrapped argv (see [session.md](session.md) §Reclaim identity) — a
   launcher around an MCP probe or an app backend still answers "not a harness", and
   one around `kiro-cli` answers that it is. Asked here they are withheld by name; asked only
   inside the seam, each first collects a gate allow and the attribution that allow
   writes. The seam still re-applies it last, because a pid can change hands
   between the two answers;
4. it carries this install's own spawn marker (`KIROCREW_SPAWNED`, via
   `runtime_reconcile.process_is_ours`), so it is ours to end;
5. it is older than `runtime_reconcile.DEFAULT_MIN_AGE_SECS` — the same
   registration window seen from the other side;
6. neither table claims the pid, and an unreadable table counts as claimed;
7. its process identity has not changed since classification, re-read in the
   instant before the signal;
8. the gate allows it — asked LAST among the authorities, because the allow path
   writes the kill attribution, so asking earlier would record a kill that never
   happened;
9. the teardown barrier commits, so a tenancy claimed after the verdict abandons
   the kill.

What the kill line records is the seam's own COUNT over the tree it walked, not a
verdict about the root: the seam signals every managed descendant it discovered and
can still withhold the root's signal afterwards, so the log and audit name the
count and the tree rather than claiming the root was killed.

Every kill decision and phase is audited in the SEL with `session_key` `gateway`
and `tool_kind` `process_kill` (`process_identity._audit_kill`):

- sweep decision rows (`audit_kill_decision`) record `allowed` or `refused` per
  pid;
- sweep phase rows (`audit_kill_phase`) record `killed` or `failed` with resources
  `allowed=N killed=M`, written only once the signal's result is known;
- the reconciler records `refused`, `killed`, `failed` and `would_kill`.

`allowed` never means killed: a phase re-judges every candidate, so only a
`killed` row says a signal happened.

Two counting rules keep the SLI honest. A call the kill seam answers by signalling
NOTHING (its own managed-agent check refused) is not a kill: counting it would
spend the whole budget on the same lowest pids every pass, forever, while the
reading reported kills and nothing changed. And a withheld pid is audited on a
CHANGE of reason, not every pass — most of the unowned population is permanently
withheld, and one row per pid per pass would evict the history an operator needs.

The dead direction acts immediately and needs no second pass: forgetting a dead
pid harms nothing and the lease holder learns its runtime died instead of waiting
out a timeout. A single liveness probe saying DEAD is still not enough on its own —
an unsignalable pid is an unknown, not an absence.

Retraction is three-valued (`retracted` / `failed` / `not-mine`) rather than a
bool. A row owned by a concurrent CLI or a predecessor gateway is a real dead
record this pass cannot remove, and a pid known only to the MCP backend pidfile, the
app backend table or the manager's in-memory union has no row in either tracking
file. Folding those
into the same `False` a real failure gets would publish one WARNING per stale pid
per tick for the gateway's life — a steady state reported as a fault.

### Platform scope

The kernel side of the unowned direction is Linux-only. It reads
`session_scope_reap.instance_slice_pids`, which enumerates `cgroup.procs` of this
install's per-instance child slice and each transient scope beneath it; an
unresolvable slice returns the EMPTY set and the pass then has nothing to compare.
Scoping to the per-instance child slice, not the shared parent, is what stops a
co-resident gateway's process reading here as one of ours with no record.

`session_scope_reap.reap_abandoned_agent_scopes` likewise reports
`supported=False` off Linux, without cgroup-v2 delegation, or with no
per-instance slice directory. The scope naming degrades the same way:
`sandbox.name_scope_unit` returns the argv unchanged wherever
`cgroup_scope_argv` hands back the bare command, and the runtime logs the unit
systemd actually received rather than one re-derived from the token, so a host
with no scope never announces one.

The `owned_dead` direction is portable: it compares records against liveness and
process identity and needs no cgroup.

## Identity: one ladder, and a pid that records its tenants

A pid answers per PROCESS, and one kiro-cli process hosts many ACP sessions, so on
a shared runtime a pid-keyed identity lookup succeeds with whichever session
published last. A wrong name is worse than no name, because the caller cannot tell
it is wrong.

**Client side** — `mcp_caller.resolve_own_identity` is the single ladder every
client-side consumer shares, so the rungs cannot drift between files. Strongest
first: (1) the protected member binding for this process, where an EMPTY string is
a refusal that must never fall through; (2) the signed per-SESSION token on this
process's own element, above the env var because a warm-pool rekey makes the env
stale; (3) `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`; (4) the `session_pid_<pid>.txt` mapping, by the
launcher-exported `KIROCREW_HOST_PID` and then by ancestor walk. Rung 4 is the one
that cannot express the tree it reads, so it REFUSES on a shared pid rather than
answering, and every caller that reaches it at all is warned. It never raises: an
identity source that can raise turns a resolvable session into a crashed tool call.

**The mapping** — `session_pid_sig` publishes `session_pid_<pid>.txt` with a
`session_pid_<pid>.sig` MAC sidecar keyed by the agent-unreadable SEL trust root
with the pid bound into the MAC. The `.txt` carries a `tenants=<n>` line and one
`tenant=<key>` line per member.

Read it through the mapping readers, not the string ones. `read_session_pid_mapping`
(lenient) and `verify_session_pid_mapping` (MAC-verified) return a
`session_pid_sig.PidMapping` whose `session_key` is non-empty only when the pid
names exactly one session; otherwise `tenants` / `tenant_count` carry what is known
and `refusal` says which kind it is (`REFUSAL_ABSENT`, `REFUSAL_MALFORMED`,
`REFUSAL_RECYCLED`, `REFUSAL_CO_TENANT`). `read_session_pid_txt` and
`verify_session_pid` are the thin `str` views of those two, kept for the historical
callers: they answer `""` for every refusal, so a caller written against them
cannot tell a co-tenanted pid from an absent file — which is the misattribution
this section exists to prevent. The refusal kind matters at the auth boundary
because a recycle is reported only after the signature verifies, so it is the
publisher's attested statement rather than ambiguity about who is calling.

**Server side** — the `.txt` is agent-readable, so membership in the roster is
necessary but never sufficient: a co-tenant can read a sibling's key out of it and
declare it. On a shared pid the caller must additionally present an
`X-Session-Token` that `session_token_sig.verify_session_token` resolves to
exactly the declared key. The full eight-step check —
`socketsec.check_peer_is_self`, the peer pid,
`peer_resolve.resolve_peer_identity(..., signed_only=True)`, the mismatch denial,
the shared-pid token demand, the unverifiable-MAC arm, the live-manager arm, and
the unresolved arm that proceeds under today's semantics — is specified in
[dashboard-token-auth.md](dashboard-token-auth.md) § *Unix-socket transport:
kernel-attested `X-Session-Key` (POSIX)* and is not repeated here.

The sidecar publication contract itself lives in [session.md](session.md) §
*session_pid sidecar contract*. Topology is pinned by
`test_identity_topology.py`.

**Liveness attribution** — `acp.liveness` states per probe whether it survives a
shared process tree, rather than claiming it for the module. The cmdline match keys
shell evidence to this session's in-flight command and attributes. The movement and
socket probes read the WHOLE tree, so a co-tenant's build reads as this session's
progress and a co-tenant's backend connection suppresses this session's wedge
signature — both err toward forbearance, which costs detection latency and no work.
The one reading acted on at once, the model-wait DEAD, is gated on a declared
`tenancy` callable: with co-tenants it degrades to UNKNOWN tagged
`liveness.EVIDENCE_SHARED_TREE`. Where attribution is impossible the verdict
degrades to UNKNOWN, never to a kill.

## Guards

### Two ratchets

Both are counts of a pattern the refactor is removing. Each may fall in any change
and may never rise, and a change that lowers one records the new number in the same
commit.

- `test/test_kill_chokepoint_ratchet.py` — `BYPASS_BASELINE` counts src sites that
  call a kill primitive without going through the gate. It also pins what a falling
  count has to MEAN: `ATTRIBUTED_KILL_PATHS` must call the gate
  (`test_attributed_kill_paths_consult_the_gate`), pass both `reason` and `caller`
  (`test_the_gate_call_names_a_caller_and_a_reason`), and act on the verdict
  (`test_the_gate_verdict_is_acted_on`) — a count driven to zero by renaming the
  primitives, with nothing logged, would satisfy a bare ceiling and leave the field
  as undiagnosable as before. A positive control
  (`test_the_needles_match_a_known_call_site`) stops an empty scan reading as total
  success.
- `test/test_pid_reader_ratchet.py` — `_BASELINE_SITES` counts src sites that read
  a runtime's pid, by AST rather than grep so reflective reads survive nesting and
  wrapping. A site whose reading genuinely belongs to the module that owns the pid
  carries an owner marker and is counted apart under `_BASELINE_OWNER_MARKED`, so
  marking a site is a visible act rather than a silent exemption. The exact-match
  test refuses a stale baseline in either direction: a baseline left above the real
  count leaves room for a future reader to fill silently.

The baseline is an invariant of the tree, not of a branch. Whoever merges after
someone else re-measures on their own tree.

### The leak and chaos gates

`test/e2e/test_process_leak_invariant.py` boots one real gateway on a throwaway
data home, drives several dashboard sessions through a full turn each, closes every
one, and then asks the kernel and the registry what survived. Four populations must
be empty: live pids in the instance's own agent slice that any session created
(with the gateway's own background runtimes as the one documented residue, bounded
by count and identified by the agent they run), managed MCP stub processes,
registry entries naming a process that is gone, and crew-log write handles held by
the gateway.

Two design points carry the gate. It runs a real gateway SUBPROCESS because two of
the four assertions are about the gateway process itself — `/proc/<pid>/fd` is only
the gateway's fd table when the gateway is its own process, and an agent slice is
only this instance's when the instance has its own data home. And the live PEAK is
asserted BEFORE the teardown, because "nothing survived" is also what a run
produces when nothing ever started.

Two switches, for the same reason: `KIROCREW_E2E` lifts the module skip, and
`KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE` turns an unmet precondition from a skip into a failure,
because pytest counts a skip as a pass. The nightly job asserts the suite reported
its expected passing count rather than trusting a zero-failure exit.

`test/e2e/test_process_chaos.py` covers the external-death direction: kill a
runtime root from outside and the registry must forget it and the lease holder must
recover.

## Known gaps

- **A session token binds only where the tables can speak.** `X-Session-Token` is
  a bearer: a same-uid process that can read `/proc/<pid>/environ` can present a
  neighbour's token. On a shared pid, a declared key is refused
  `peer_session_unbound` unless a lease or a tenancy places it on the nearest
  chain pid (`session_keys_bound_to_pid`, read by
  `token_auth._bound_session_keys_on_chain`). The residual gap is the empty case:
  when neither table speaks about the pid the check changes nothing and the token
  keeps fail-open bearer semantics. Tracked in issue #14646 together with the
  recycled-ancestor case, where the lenient MCP identity refuses every call for an
  identity-less caller.
- **The `tenancy` seam in `acp.liveness.LivenessOracle` has no production
  declarer.** All four construction sites take the single-tenant reading, so the
  model-wait DEAD verdict is not degraded on a shared runtime. Wiring it means
  passing a lease-plus-claim count from each site.
- **A shared runtime dying during session start advances every auto-nudge loop's
  start-failure streak on that process** (issue #14657). The start path raises
  without carrying the runtime's identity, so the death cannot be attributed.
- **`providers/base.py` still exposes process-shaped members.** Abort does not use
  them: it takes the opaque `RuntimeAbortTarget` from `runtime_abort_target()`. The remaining members are the bulk of what the pid
  reader ratchet still counts; each needs classifying as a session-level question,
  a runtime handle, or a reading whose owner is the module that holds the pid.
- **`cap` is not open.** Raising `CHAT_RUNTIME_CAP` needs eligibility rules that
  decide which sessions may share a process, and a flag to stage it. Neither
  exists, so every runtime serves one session.
- **Membership is narrower than the slice it is compared against.** The app
  backend table claims each spawned backend's root process, plus that root's direct
  children where the gateway's wrap inserted a forking sandbox launcher (so the
  launcher's forked server child is covered). An adopted backend
  (one found already listening on its port), the processes a spawned backend forks
  BELOW that server child, and a backend spawned by another process on this data home
  are in no record, so
  when they run in the slice they are unowned on every pass, and what keeps them
  unsignalled is the argv condition rather than an ownership record. A long-lived
  sandboxed subprocess is the other case and answers by identity
  instead: the sandbox chokepoint stamps `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_TOOL` on its whole tree
  and `_unowned` excludes a pid that carries it and is not a managed harness, so
  tool work leaves the candidate population on exec-time evidence rather than on
  its argv0. Both conditions are required because the marker is inherited while the
  argv test is per process: a harness leaked inside a tool tree carries the marker
  without being tool work, and stays a candidate. The excluded population is
  therefore exactly the one the argv condition withheld already — the kill arm's
  reach is the same, and what the exclusion removes is their per-pass count, gate
  allow and kill attribution.
