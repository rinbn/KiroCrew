"""The gates on a template, in one implementation both the tests import.

``mypy`` checks the provider: a :class:`~typing.TypedDict` in, the contract out,
required keys and all. It cannot see inside an html file, so the html end of the
agreement needs a reader of its own. This is that reader, plus the two structural
rules a contract must satisfy.

Written with the stdlib html parser rather than a regular expression, deliberately.
An attribute scan by regex mis-reads the cases that matter -- an attribute inside a
comment, a value quoted with the other quote character, a tag name in upper case --
and each of those makes the gate QUIETLY incomplete, which is worse than a gate that
fails: a field the extractor missed reads as a field the html does not use, so the
equality assertion passes over a real mismatch.

Every function here refuses rather than returning a partial answer. A partial answer
is indistinguishable from a template that genuinely uses fewer fields, and that is
the one direction an equality assertion cannot catch on its own.
