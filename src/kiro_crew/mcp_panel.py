"""MCP server ``kirocrew-panel`` — a crew fills in its own webview.

Every crew gets a webview in its drawer, and this server is the one write path
into it. A long-running crew knows things nobody can read: how many workers it
holds, which one is stuck, what it will do next, whether anything is waiting on
a decision.

Deliberately narrow: the crew publishes a DATA OBJECT and names a TEMPLATE to
render it with. It never sends markup, because the template is the human-authored
half.

Why this is its own server, not a tool on an existing one
--------------------------------------------------------
Assignment is per server, so the server IS the unit of authorization. The
dashboard server's set is ratcheted to folder organization plus session control
and a document-publishing tool belongs to neither class; putting it there would
widen a set the user granted for something else. So it gets a server, marked
``opt_in`` in ``agent._MANAGED_MCP_SERVERS``, which means a default agent's
spec carries neither the entry nor an ``@kirocrew-panel`` reference and spends
no context on it. Only an agent whose own spec names the set can reach it.

Why the tool has no session argument
------------------------------------
The panel a call writes is derived from the CALLING SESSION's identity,
resolved strictly, and passed explicitly to the transport so the value that was
checked is the value that is used. The lenient resolver walks ``/proc``
ancestors, and a subagent lives inside its parent slot's process tree — that
walk would let a subagent overwrite its parent's panel. A subagent has no panel
of its own and is told so.
