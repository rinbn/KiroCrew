"""scaffold.py -- emit one dashboard template's four files from a field list.

    scaffold.py <slug> --fold work --fields open:fraction goal:'str|unsaid'

Writes, under the repository root it is run from:

    src/kiro_crew/dashboard_templates/<slug>.html
    src/kiro_crew/dashboard_templates/<slug>_contract.py
    src/kiro_crew/dashboard_templates/<slug>_provider.py
    test/test_dashboard_template_<slug>.py

and prints the one registration line to paste into ``registry.py``.

The point of the script is that the mechanical part is not judgment. A template's
html, contract, provider and parity test must agree on one field list, and a human
transcribing that list four times will get it wrong in the direction that is silent:
a field in the page and not the contract renders an empty cell. So the list is stated
once, here, and the four files are derived from it.

What it does NOT decide: which fold answers the question, what the page should say,
or whether a number belongs on it at all. Those are the author's, and the skill body
is where they are argued.

Field kinds
-----------

``str|unsaid``     text read out of the fold, which may not carry it
``fraction``       a count, rendered ``N/M``; the ONLY way a number reaches a page

There is no bare ``str``. Every field an author declares is read out of the fold, and a
fold value can always be absent -- that is the premise of ``read_text`` -- so a declared
text field is ``str | Unsaid`` or it is a contract the provider cannot satisfy. Plain
``str`` exists only for the two fields this script supplies itself (``contract_version``,
``captured_at``), which the provider writes rather than reads.

There is no bare ``int``. A count as a plain number has to answer two questions with
no safe default -- what its total is, and what to show when the fold does not carry it
-- and both wrong answers are silent: a bare "7" reads as complete information, and a
zero standing in for an unknown reads as good news. A ``fraction`` field reads
``<name>`` and ``<name>_of`` out of the fold and renders ``N/M``, or the words "not
said" when either side is missing.

Every template also gets ``contract_version``, ``captured_at`` and the three judgment
fields (``lede``, ``you``, ``notes``) without asking, because every card carries them:
the version so a reader can branch on the shape it was handed, the stamp so a reader
knows how old the page is, and the judgments because they are the only values a
publisher may write at run time.
