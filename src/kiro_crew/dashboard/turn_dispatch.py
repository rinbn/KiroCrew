"""Guarded dispatch for dashboard chat turns.

Every chat turn runs under a wall-clock ceiling so a genuinely runaway turn
cannot pin a session forever. Reaching that ceiling must always produce a
VISIBLE outcome: an error card and a row in the session transcript. A dispatch
that only wrapped the turn in ``asyncio.wait_for`` and attached
``state._background_tasks.discard`` — a ``set`` method that ignores its
argument's result — never retrieves the resulting ``TimeoutError``, so the turn
simply stops, leaving nothing but a garbage-collection-time "Task exception was
never retrieved" message and a failure indistinguishable from the agent going
quiet.

The ceiling is an ordinary outcome of long-running work, not a rare edge case: a
babysit loop polling a pull request reaches it routinely — ten review rounds at
roughly five minutes of waiting each, plus the tool time in between.

This module owns the one dispatch path. Keeping the ceiling, the clamp against
the transport's own timeout, and the visible-card guarantee together here is
deliberate: re-deriving them at each call site lets a new site silently
reintroduce the silent death by copying an ``add_done_callback(discard)`` shape.
