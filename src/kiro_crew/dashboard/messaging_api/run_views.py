    layer does not reach into the manager's private helpers. The duplication is

        Two bounds with different reach. The app bound is unconditional, because
        an app token must never read another app's run text no matter how its
        session scope resolved. The session bound is conditional on
        ``internal_auth`` -- the same condition the live branch above applies to
        the same field -- so the durable half of one listing is neither wider nor
        narrower than the live half a caller sees beside it. It is deliberately
        NOT conditional on the resolved memory store: that answers empty for a
        verified internal caller on the default store exactly as it does for the
        dashboard owner, so it would lift the bound for nearly every attested
        caller it exists to bind.

        Both read only the request's own values and the record, so they are sound
        on a worker thread. The ownership dimension is not: it answers from live
        slot state, so here it consults the loop-taken snapshot and sizes the cap
        only, and the record is decided again on the loop before it is listed.

        Every refusal is a permission decision and leaves a SEL record under the
        reason it actually had -- a lazily hydrated slot is `slot_missing`, not an
        ownership breach.
