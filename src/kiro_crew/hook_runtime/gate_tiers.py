"""The tool gate's tiers: what each row of ``hooks.GATE_TIERS`` checks.

``HookManager.judge`` walks ``GATE_TIERS`` in table order and returns the first
verdict a tier hands back, so the ORDER is the table's and nothing here calls
another tier. A tier body answers one question about one call and returns a
``ToolHookResult`` through its counted factories, or ``None`` to let the next row
decide. :class:`GateFacts` carries the call, the surface asking, and the values
the tiers derive from them, derived on first use from one platform-context
snapshot per judgement (the effective deny set is resolved twice from it).

Composed onto ``kiro_crew.hooks``; see :mod:`kiro_crew.hook_runtime`. The tier
bodies read the facade's globals at call time, so a test that patches
``hooks.<name>`` (``_governance_denial``, ``sensitive_path_refusal``,
``current_context``, ``_cu_read_only_auto_approve`` …) reaches the tier that uses
it.

    on every target regardless of prefix, or credential reads slip through on the

def _tier_app_own_server(facts: GateFacts, tier: GateTier) -> ToolHookResult | None:
    """A FIRST-PARTY (builtin) app agent calling its OWN app-scoped MCP server.

    That is intra-app, not a host surface. A builtin app's declared server is
    registered under the ``<app>:<server>`` key (see ``apps/bridges.py``) and IS the
    gateway's own shipped code, so it only touches the app's own data -- never
    fs/network/exec/exfil on the host. Once a shipped app agent stopped
    pre-authorizing tools (no template ``allowedTools``, the "no template
    pre-authorizes tools" invariant), even those intra-app calls fell through to an
    interactive prompt the user could not meaningfully act on (the app was blocked
    from talking to itself). Auto-approving them here restores that UX without
    re-widening any host grant.

    Keyed on the NON-model-authored ``mcp_server`` (the ACP
    ``_meta.kiro.mcpServerName``), NEVER on the LLM-authored title: a
    prompt-injected agent can title a Bash call ``mcp__<app>:srv__x``, but kiro-cli
    only sets ``mcp_server`` for a genuine MCP-served call, so a forged shell/host
    title carries an empty server name and never matches (fail-closed). Restricted
    to builtins on purpose: only a builtin's server is provably first-party. A
    THIRD-PARTY app's server is arbitrary installed code whose internals the gate
    cannot see, so its own-server calls are NOT auto-approved here -- the OS
    sandbox it runs under and the third-party admission gate bound its behavior
    instead.

    Placed AFTER every deny tier and governance in the table, so a ceiling/profile
    can still deny even a builtin's own server and every sensitive-path / keystone
    / exfil deny still wins; and before the interactive fall-through, independent
    of the Normal/Read/Trust tier (that tier governs the HOST tools an app agent may
    reach, not the app talking to its own server). Generic App Kit contract keyed
    only on the ``<app>:<server>`` convention + shipped-manifest provenance -- no
    per-app special-casing.

    ``_app_owns_mcp_server`` only proves the NAME is ``<app>:``-prefixed;
    ``_own_mcp_servers`` (bridges.py) injects app servers into the agent by reading
    that prefix from the MUTABLE global MCP config, so a ``<app>:evil`` entry that
    landed there (not declared by the app) would otherwise be trusted. The server
    must be DECLARED in the app's SHIPPED manifest
    (``_is_declared_builtin_mcp_server``, an in-memory set warmed at boot from
    immutable manifests -- same discipline as ``_BUILTIN_APP_NAMES``) so only a
    genuinely app-own server auto-approves.

    An app identity is recovered for a builtin whose slot carries NONE. Only a
    request with an authenticated app scope sets ``Slot._app``, so a builtin whose
    UI is not an app iframe (an Electron window using the dashboard session cookie)
    binds its slot with an empty app and every condition keyed on it fails -- the
    app could not talk to its own server. The slot's own ``app`` wins whenever it
    HAS one, so an app-scoped session behaves exactly as before; the derived value
    is used ONLY for this grant and is never written back to the slot (see
    ``_builtin_app_for_agent`` -- ``_app`` also drives app isolation). Keyed on
    ``resolved_agent`` (what ACTUALLY ran), NEVER on ``agent``: the latter is the
    slot's ALIAS, which ``resolve_agent_bindings`` maps to a concrete kiro agent
    before dispatch, so a user-defined alias named after a builtin's agent could
    otherwise borrow that app's identity for a completely different runtime agent.
    An empty ``resolved_agent`` (an uncached permission event, or a caller that does
    not thread it through) yields no identity -- fail-closed to interactive
    approval.

    Both grant tiers vouch for the CALLER and say nothing about what the call does,
    so ``classifier_only`` skips them and the read-only classifier judges the call
    on its own merits (a grant that shadows a read costs nothing, a grant that
    shadows a write approves nothing). The owner app is resolved before that check,
    as it always was, so a malformed resolved agent is refused (as a gate crash)

    -- safe here ONLY because a shell call whose command could not be recovered was
    already hard-denied by the first tier, so no unverified command can reach it.
    Do not weaken that refusal without also gating this tier.

    model-authored ``description`` that reads like an allowed tool approve a
    different one; keyed on the identity, the pattern approves exactly the tool
    that executes. Two spellings of the same identity: kiro-cli's own title form
    ``Running: @server/tool`` and the governance reference ``@server/tool``

    a grant target: a server or tool name may itself contain ``__``, so two
    different verified identities can share one wire spelling, and a grant written
    against it would approve the other tool. The deny list may accept that form
    (over-denying is safe); a grant may not. An identity that is present but
    unproven falls back to the title, exactly as before.

    AFTER every deny tier (deny-by-default shell, sensitive-path, sensitive-bash,
    exfil, write-protected-config, the effective deny set, the file-search target)
    and governance. Its position guarantees a read-only classification can never
    re-admit anything a tier above blocked. This re-homes the "reads don't nag" UX
    now that kiro-cli's autoAllowReadonly is retired. The ``slack.gateway`` import
    is function-local: ``slack.gateway`` imports hooks at module top, so a
    module-level import would create a boot import cycle. The bash classifier lives
    on the security surface, which the facade already imports at top, so it needs
    no such dodge.

    Every auto-approve here carries ``read_only=True``: a verdict about the call's
    EFFECT, and the only auto-approve ``ToolApprovalPolicy.READ_ONLY`` honours. The
    grant tiers stay untagged.

    Under ``classifier_only`` the classifier tightens WHAT counts as proof: with no
    approver to catch an over-approval, read-only must follow from HOST-TRUSTED
    facts alone -- the recovered shell ``command`` judged by ``is_read_only_bash``,
    or a built-in the host knows to be read-only, named by the non-model-authored
    ``mcp_tool`` with no ``mcp_server`` (``_HOST_READ_ONLY_BUILTIN_TOOLS``) AND

    the ``_meta.kiro`` parse this client made of the tool_call frame
    (``AcpEvent.mcp_identity_trusted``) rather than from an inline payload or a
    hand-built event -- without it a host-known name is unproven and refused. On
    claude, which stamps no ``_meta.kiro``, the same built-in is named by
    ``harness_builtin_tool``, mapped from the tool name claude-agent-acp stamped on
    the tool_call frame (``_is_harness_read_only_builtin``). The
    agent-influenced inputs -- the ACP ``kind`` and the title -- may NARROW (a
    non-read kind refuses) but never prove, so a mutating tool labelled
    ``kind="read"`` or titled ``Read …`` is not auto-approved; an MCP-served tool,
