      ``fs_read`` there is prose, not identity. This is the same flag
      ``event_is_spawn_run`` demands before it trusts a tool identity.
    * ``mcp_tool_name`` non-empty — ``_meta.kiro.toolName``, which kiro-cli
      sets for built-ins too. Empty (a backend that omits ``_meta.kiro``, an
      uncached permission event) identifies nothing and matches nothing.
    * ``mcp_server_name`` empty — kiro-cli stamps ``mcpServerName`` on every
      MCP-served call, so an MCP server exposing a tool that happens to be
      called ``fs_read`` carries a server name and fails closed here. Only a

    stamping contract; that contract belongs to kiro-cli
    (``kiro_tool_identity_meta`` in the engine) and is the one every
    ``mcp_server_name`` consumer in ``kiro_crew.hooks`` already rests on.

    The stamped name is read through ``_HOST_READ_ONLY_BUILTIN_ALIASES`` first.
    kiro-cli names its file-read built-in ``read`` (``fs_read`` is the alias it
    still accepts in a spec), while the allowlist and ``BUILTIN_TOOL_SCOPES``
    carry ``fs_read``; without the step a ``read`` call is unproven and a

    Recovers an app identity for a slot whose ``_app`` is empty. ``Slot._app``
    comes from the request's AUTHENTICATED app scope, so a builtin app whose UI
    is not an app iframe — e.g. an Electron window that authenticates with the
    dashboard session cookie — binds its slot with NO app identity, and its
    calls to its OWN MCP server never satisfy the gate's app-own-server tier
    (``_tier_app_own_server``; ``_app_owns_mcp_server`` returns False for a
    blank app).

    The argument MUST be the RESOLVED agent (what actually served the turn, i.e.
    ``AcpClient._agent`` / ``read_effective_agent``), never ``Slot.agent``. The
    slot's agent is an ALIAS that ``resolve_agent_bindings`` maps to a concrete
    kiro agent before dispatch — a slot set to ``default`` can be served by
    ``kirocrew`` — so an alias NAMED after a builtin's agent would otherwise lend
    that app's identity to a different runtime agent entirely. Keying on the
    resolved id makes the grant follow what ran, matching the precedence
    ``read_effective_agent`` already establishes for usage attribution. The map
    itself is built solely from IMMUTABLE shipped manifests, so nothing the
    client sent decides which app an agent belongs to.

    Used ONLY to satisfy the app-own-server auto-approve. Deliberately NOT
    written back to ``Slot._app``: that field also drives app ISOLATION (which
    app may delete or retitle a slot), so marking a dashboard-created slot
    app-owned would widen those checks. Pure in-memory lookup; fail-closed before
    the map is warmed and for an empty resolved agent.

    Composing the reference directly cannot mis-split, because the segments are
    joined by ``/`` and neither an MCP server nor an MCP tool name contains one.
