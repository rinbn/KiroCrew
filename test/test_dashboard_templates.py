"""The dashboard-template machinery: the three invariants, and the scaffold that holds them.

A template is an html page plus a ``TypedDict`` plus a provider. ``mypy`` checks the
provider's two ends; nothing checks the page, so a field the page reads and the contract
omits renders an empty cell and nobody is accountable for it. These tests are that
missing check, plus the two rules about what a number and a gap may look like.

Every gate here also carries a PLANTED failure. The registry ships empty -- the first
templates arrive with the work that needs them -- and a gate whose only evidence is
"nothing is wrong" would read the same way whether it worked or not. So each rule is
asserted against a deliberately broken input in the same run.
